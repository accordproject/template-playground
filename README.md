This repository hosts the Accord Project Template-Playground. Templates are resourced using the [Template-Engine](https://github.com/accordproject/template-engine), rich-text templates are defined in TemplateMark (either as markdown files, or JSON documents) and are then merged with JSON data to produce output documents.

## Accord Project Playground

**Project Overview**

The Accord Project Template-Playground is a web-based platform designed to empower developers of all backgrounds to learn and experiment with Accord Project functionalities in a user-friendly and interactive environment. It is a Web playground for Accord Project templates:

1. TemplateMark for the natural language text.
2. [Concerto](https://docs.accordproject.org/docs/model-concerto.html) for the data model.
3. TypeScript for logic within the templates.
4. [Markdown-Transform](https://github.com/accordproject/markdown-transform) to transform the output to HTML, PDF etc.
5. [Template-Engine](https://github.com/accordproject/template-engine) to convert TemplateMark + JSON data to AgreementMark.
   This playground aims to bridge the gap between static documentation and active learning by providing:

**Interactive Template Samples** Users can directly edit and test template samples and see the corresponding output in a live preview environment, fostering a hands-on learning experience.

**Interactive Features:**

- Live template testing and editing with syntax highlighting and error checking.
- Real-time preview of code execution results.
- Share your edited templates with other users through generated shareable links.

**Getting Involved**

The Accord Project Playground is an open-source project, welcoming contributions from the developer community. Here are some ways to participate:

- **Feature Implementation:** Help build core functionalities like interactive code editing, live preview, and integrated learning resources.
- **Learning Module Development:** Create interactive modules to showcase specific Accord Project functionalities.
- **Functionality Enhancements:** Improve existing features based on user feedback and project needs.
- **Documentation and Tutorials:** Contribute to comprehensive documentation and tutorials that guide users through the platform effectively.
